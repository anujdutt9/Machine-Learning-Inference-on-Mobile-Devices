    "In this tutorial, we'll take a SSD(Lite) Mobilenet v2 model and deploy it on an iOS device using CoreML. The ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_coco downloaded folder contains the trained SSD model in a few different formats: a frozen graph, a checkpoint, and a SavedModel. tfcoreml needs to use a frozen graph but the downloaded one gives errors — it contains “cycles” or loops, which are a no-go for tfcoreml. We’ll use the SavedModel and convert it to a frozen graph without cycles."
